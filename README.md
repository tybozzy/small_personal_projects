# Personal Projects

### A collection of smaller personal projects that do not warrant the need for their own repository.

Most are one-off scripts that were created in little time for practice or fun, and some are not as well polished as they could be. Yet, they are still a great example of my code.

\
*Note: These scripts are hardly intended for real-world use, and are only intended to be used for my personal archival and professional development purposes.*
